I will be creating a repository to show the skills I learned and I will be learning with Exel 




** Types of data analysis

### Qualitative

It is about analyzing data on opinions, attitudes, beliefs, etc.

### Quantitative

It is hard data and information that can be measured and accounted for. In this method we can ask ourselves:

How many?
Who?
How often?
Where?


### Steps for a good Data Analysis:

Step 1: define the questions to be answered. They must be measurable and clear.
Step 2‚Äù Establish Priorities. Establish what data we want to analyze.
Step 3: Collect the data. Choose the data collection method (external databases, interviews, etc.)
Step 4: Analyze the data. Analyze the data more deeply, find relationships, trends, filter them etc.
Step 5: Interpret the data. See if the data answers your original question, helps you defend any objections, is there any limitation in the conclusions, sees if there is anything we haven't considered.




### How to convert data into tables

First we select all the data and at first we format it as a table and we select the option that we like and if the table has headers we select the option, another option is with the CTRL + T command and we select the range of the table and it we accept

### We can assign a name to the table with this option:

We can also refer to the table with the name and the cell

If we want to add data to the table it is very easy since we can create a new column by writing the name after the last column or inserting a new column:

With tables we have the advantage that if we create a new column and apply a formula to that column, the formula
It will be applied to the whole column and we don't have to do it one by one.

With the table we have several options to be able to modify the table, one of them would be the option row of totals that the function would be to calculate the data of the columns of the table and show the total totals, average, max, min and many more options
