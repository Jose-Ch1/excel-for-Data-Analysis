# Excel-for-Data-Analysis
I will be creating a repository to show the skills I learned and I will be learning with Exel 




** Types of data analysis

### Qualitative

It is about analyzing data on opinions, attitudes, beliefs, etc.

### Quantitative

It is hard data and information that can be measured and accounted for. In this method we can ask ourselves:

How many?
Who?
How often?
Where?


### Steps for a good Data Analysis:

Step 1: define the questions to be answered. They must be measurable and clear.
Step 2‚Äù Establish Priorities. Establish what data we want to analyze.
Step 3: Collect the data. Choose the data collection method (external databases, interviews, etc.)
Step 4: Analyze the data. Analyze the data more deeply, find relationships, trends, filter them etc.
Step 5: Interpret the data. See if the data answers your original question, helps you defend any objections, is there any limitation in the conclusions, sees if there is anything we haven't considered.




### How to convert data into tables

First we select all the data and at first we format it as a table and we select the option that we like and if the table has headers we select the option, another option is with the CTRL + T command and we select the range of the table and it we accept

### We can assign a name to the table with this option:

We can also refer to the table with the name and the cell

If we want to add data to the table it is very easy since we can create a new column by writing the name after the last column or inserting a new column:


![1 5 tabla](https://github.com/Jose-Ch1/excel-for-Data-Analysis/assets/123495174/cdaca047-2df0-4517-a7aa-10724e1240a0)

With tables we have the advantage that if we create a new column and apply a formula to that column, the formula
It will be applied to the whole column and we don't have to do it one by one.

With the table we have several options to be able to modify the table, one of them would be the option row of totals that the function would be to calculate the data of the columns of the table and show the total totals, average, max, min and many more options

# Filters

We can use filters, with the filters we have many options with which we can filter by columns (We can select one or several) we can also sort by alphabetical order (ascending or descending), by number (descending, ascending) etc.

------------
### We can also use data segmentation that would help us group data quickly and efficiently.


What we have to do is go to data then data segmentation and select the data we want to filter, then some boxes appear and we place them where it is easier to manipulate them. And only by selecting an option is the table automatically filtered (we can select several options.

# How to remove duplicates

### To eliminate duplicates we can do it in the following ways:

1- Advanced filter: in this option we go to the data part, then to filters and select the advanced filter option here we can filter the information in the same place and copy it to another place, in this case we will select in another place. Then we select the range of the table and select the criteria (The criteria are the headers), we select where we want to copy the information and if we want to eliminate duplicates, we mark the option and click OK.
2- The other option is not to copy the data and modify the table.
3- If we have office 365 we can use the unique function

# VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP functions


The XLOOKUP and LYLOOKUP functions are used to find items in a table or range by row.
Next, let's create some examples where we can use the find V and find X functions.
 

## VLOOKUP

To use the find v function we have to write the function then we have to fill in the information we need to use it.

1.  We have to select the Celtic that we are going to look for.
2.  Select the database where d is to search.
3.  select which column number the function will bring us.
4.  Select whether we want an approximate (true) or exact (false) match.

If when we are in the third option we go to the side of the table name and we select more options and then we select the option called column and then we select a reference column and then we only set the column but not the row as the second image we can make VLOOKUP easier and more efficient to use

##### When we use VLOOKUP and the data is not found, it shows us an error to solve that, we are going to use the VLOOKUP with the IF function, we can achieve a treatment for the errors.

# XLOOKUP function

With the XLOOKUP function we have to fill the matrix to look for the value, the matrix has 5 values, 3 of which are mandatory and 2 optional.

- We have to select the value that we are going to look for.

- We have to select the matrix where we are going to look for the data.

- We have to select the matrix that we want returned, in this case it is the lastname column.

- We can choose what we want to happen if there is an error.

- We choose if we want the searched value to be exact and not.

####  With XLOOKUP's dynamic arrays, we can look up multiple data with just the id.

We select the cell that we are going to search, the data matrix in which we are going to search it and we are going to select the data that we are going to need and we select all the data from the columns.
